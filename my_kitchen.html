	<strong>Instructions</strong>

	<li>Preheat the oven to 400F.</li>

<li>In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil and honey. Season with salt and pepper to taste; set aside.</li>

<li>Take one pastry sheet and cut it in half (Note: as mentioned above, I used one Pepperidge Farm Puff Pastry Sheet, which I cut in half to make two pizzas, so if using another brand you may or may not have to cut in half depending on size. There is no perfect portion so use your stomach senses :).</li>

<li>Roll out one pastry half on lightly floured surface 1/4â€³-inch thick. It does not have to to be perfect. Transfer to parchment lined baking sheet. Brush with the olive oil and honey mixture. Pierce the pastry with a fork to prevent bubbling.</li>

<li>Bake in the oven for 6 minutes. </li>

<li>Remove from the oven (if pastry bubbles up, lightly pierce with fork before adding parmesan).</li>

<li> Sprinkle with 1/3 cup parmesan cheese and continue baking for additional 4 minutes or until lightly golden.</li>

<li> Remove from the oven and brush lightly with additional olive oil and honey mixture; cool completely. (Note: keep an eye on the pastry during the second part of baking as the parmesan cheese burns very easily! Your baking time may vary a bit, depending on the oven).</li>

<li>Follow steps 5-6 to prepare the second half of pastry.</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
